&quot;1&quot;;&quot;Tomato Soup&quot;;&quot;Becca R&quot;;&quot;5 tablespoons butter
1 large onion, yellow or white, diced
4 large cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons freshly cracked pepper
3 tablespoons flour
1 (28 oz) can crushed or diced tomatoes
1 (8 oz) can tomato sauce
4 cups (32 oz) low sodium chicken stock
1 tablespoon sugar&quot;;&quot;1 Sauté the onions and garlic: In a Dutch oven set over medium heat, add the butter. Once it starts to foam, add the onion, garlic, salt, and pepper. Stir until both have softened and are fragrant, about 7 minutes. 2 Make the roux: Add flour. Stir to make a paste. Continue stirring until the flour has taken on a light brown color. Stir and scrape with wooden spoon, 5-7 minutes. The onion paste should look golden with a little brown caramelization. 3 Add tomatoes and stock: Add crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken stock, and sugar. Stir to combine. Cover the pot and bring to a boil over medium high heat, then reduce heat to medium and let simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes. 4 Purée and serve: Purée the soup with an immersion blender. Alternatively, fill a countertop blender less than halfway with the hot soup. Remove the center lid insert. This allows the hot steam to escape. Cover the hole with a folded kitchen towel and place your hand over the top. Blend. Repeat as necessary until all of the soup has been puréed. 5.Enjoy!&quot;
